#Kana Reference

This is a small app for people learning Japanese. Imagine walking on the streets of tokyo, seeing a sign telling you　フレー　コーキス and not understanding that someone is giving out free cookies. You'd wish you have a small reference for Japanese phonetic script. You wish you had this app. But you didnt. Sucks to be you.
