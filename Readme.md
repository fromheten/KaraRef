#Kana Reference

This is a small app for people learning Japanese. Imagine walking on the streets of Tokyo, seeing a sign telling you　フレー　コーキス and not understanding that someone is giving out free cookies. You'd wish you have a small reference for Japanese phonetic script. You wish you had this app. But you didnt. Sucks to be you.

You can do whatever you want with the code, but not publish it in any app stores or sell it. Thanks.
